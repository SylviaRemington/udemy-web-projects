  <!-- And as per Angela Yu -->
   <!-- " Can I use these Capstone projects in my job interviews? Yes! That's the point of these capstone projects. 
    Unlike course projects, which have solution code and video walkthroughs, Capstone Projects are meant to be 
    entirely your "own work". The capstone projects have no solution code, no walk through, no design specs. It 
    is purely your creation So it can definitely be counted as your own work and be added to your portfolio.
    
    When I hire developers, I always ask for a portfolio. I consider 
    what they have built by themselves to be far more important than which University they went to or if they have a computer science degree. 
    Many of my friends who are CEOs in multi-nationals and startups agree. " -->
