<!-- These are practice Udemy Web Projects for the course by Angela Yu - Become a Full-Stack Web Developer 
"The Complete Web Development Bootcamp" - I'm going through this in addition to General Assembly 
so that I can fully understand coding concepts and get more practice in areas I am currently weak in...
including JS. I plan on getting good at full stack with an emphasis on Front End Dev.

I just require more information in a different format so that I fully understand certain concepts. -->
