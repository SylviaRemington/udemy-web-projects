## **These are practice Udemy Web Projects within the Angela Yu course: Become a Full-Stack Web Developer - "The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp"**  

I'm going through this in addition to General Assembly 
so that I can fully understand coding concepts and get more practice in areas I am currently weak in...
including JS. 

I plan on getting good at full stack with an emphasis in Front End Dev.

I just require more information in a different format so that I fully understand certain concepts. 

Additionally, I plan on going through the full Dr. Angela Yu's "The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp" Course while I'm in General Assembly. Even though my GA instructor Tristan Hall rocks and explains code and concepts really well, and is curious and helpful, and always is willing and interested in answering any questions, 
I still find Angela's teaching style and lessons more geared to my way of thinking (which is more visual,
creative, looking at the big picture and big concepts prior to focusing on the details). And her teachings,
coupled with General Assembly is helping me understand and "get" the concepts faster and better. Yay.
