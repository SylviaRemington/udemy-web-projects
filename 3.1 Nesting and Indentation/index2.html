 <!-- Angela Yu's version - she's nesting lists within the list item tag / This is different from what I did since I closed the tag and then moved on. They both look the same for the end target, just a little bit differrent how she got there. -->
<!-- This is the corrected version. Line 13 above is where it isn't fully correct. Even though it looks ok on browser, it sin't accurate because the list item should have an ul inside of it. Just more complicated nesting. That's all.  -->
