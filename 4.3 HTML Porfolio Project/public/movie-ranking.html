 <h2>My 3 top movies:</h2>

 <hr>
 
 <h3>Terminator 2</h3>
 <p>Classic action-adventure sci fi! This movie is a classic!</p>

 <br>

 <h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
 <p>One of the most well-done musicals of all time. The composers, editors, actors, choreographers are all the greatest in their fields. This truly is a work of art. And fun fact, this amazing movie almost didn't get made!

 <h3>Hamilton</h3>
 <p>Another great musical. This is a recording of the live Hamilton theater experience with the original cast. So good. The lyricist, the composing, the choreography, the performers are the best in the field. And the nuances and subtleties of choreography, set design, and music is phenomenal.

 <h3>Chung King Express</h3>
 <p>Art-house indie movie. So good. I loved this one in the 90's.</p>
