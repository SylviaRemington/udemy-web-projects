<h1>About Me</h1>

<!-- Could also do this as a ul if I want bullet points. But I don't want that right now. Prefer it this way. -->
<p>Creative developer. <br> World traveler. <br> And former dancer & comedian... <br>Now turning code into connection.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Sylvia ‚Äî a creative developer with a background that spans global dance tours, stand-up comedy, film production, graphic design support, and even retail teamwork at Trader Joe's. I've performed on stages around the world, helped artists bring ideas to life, and now I'm channeling that same energy into building web apps that are expressive, useful, and human-centered.</p>

<p>I bring curiosity, visual instinct, and experience from working and traveling across Costa Rica, Nepal, Japan, London, Dublin, Barcelona, Rome, New York City, and beyond. 
  I love collaborating with people from all walks of life and cultures!</p>

<p>To me, software development is another form of creativity. And I'm here to make technology that connects, empowers, and inspires.</p>
