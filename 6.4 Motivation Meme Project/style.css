/* * {

/* Notes: The "*" selects every single element on the page. Applying to every box that exists. 

That includes:
• html
• body
• div
• h1
• p
• img
• everything else

Also...

Good use cases for *:
• Resetting defaults (margins, padding)
• Very broad rules you truly want everywhere
• Establishing a universal baseline */

* {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;

}

/* Notes for html & html vs *: 

Good use cases for html:
• Setting base font size (for rem units)
• Page-wide defaults that are meant to be inherited
• Structural, root-level decisions

Why they (html & *) feel similar (but aren’t). Both affect the whole page, but in different ways:

*
• Directly styles every element
• Applies rule by force
• Does not rely on inheritance

html
• Styles the root
• Other elements may inherit from it
• More subtle and controlled

That’s why this makes sense: font size on html because everything references it.

And this also makes sense: resets or emergency rules on *.

/* Best Practices CSS Rules for order of things per a search is as follows:

The Real Reason is the CSS Cascade:

When CSS has conflicting rules, later properties can override earlier ones. 
This order groups properties by how specific they are and what they affect the following

1. Layout/Box Model First
These properties affect positioning of other elements and the document flow:
- If you change width or display, everything else about the element shifts.
- These properties are like the foundation - they determine the space everything else lives in.

2. Typography Second
Font and text properties can affect the size of the container:
- Different fonts have different sizes even at the same font-size
- line-height affects vertical spacing
- If you set colors first, then change font size and the box grows, you might have to adjust colors again

3. Colors/Backgrounds Third
These properties don't affect layout at all:
- Changing color from white to red doesn't move anything
- Changing background-color doesn't change where elements sit
- They're "skin deep" - purely visual without affecting structure

4. Other Properties Last
These are the most specific overrides:
- Things like text-transform, box-shadow, opacity
- They're often the "finishing touches" you add after everything else is working*/


/* Ways To Group It For The Future: 

==========================================================================
   1. GLOBAL / BASE STYLES
==========================================================================
* {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
}

html {
    font-size: 20px;
}

==========================================================================
   2. LAYOUT / STRUCTURE
========================================================================== 
div {
    width: 50%;
    margin-left: 25%;
}

==========================================================================
   3. ELEMENT-LEVEL STYLES
==========================================================================
img {
    border: 5px solid white;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    margin-top: 20px;
}

==========================================================================
   4. REUSABLE CLASSES
========================================================================== 
.verbiage {
    text-align: center;
   
    **Below is the Font CSS class for a variable style:**
    font-family: "Libre Baskerville", serif;
    font-optical-sizing: auto;
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
}

==========================================================================
   5. SPECIFIC OVERRIDES (IDs come last so they can override classes if needed)
==========================================================================
#title {
    font-size: 2rem;
}

#motivation {
    font-size: 1rem;
}
